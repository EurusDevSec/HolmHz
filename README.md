## 🧐 Introduction

**HolmHz** (derived from *Sherlock Holmes* + *Hertz*) is a Deepfake Detection System that observes what the human eye cannot see.

While traditional models focus on the visual domain (RGB), HolmHz investigates the **Frequency Domain** and **Noise Artifacts** left behind by Generative AI models (GANs, Diffusion/Midjourney).

*"You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear."* — Sherlock Holmes.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Dual-Stream Architecture:**
  - 👁️ **Spatial Stream:** Analyzes visual anomalies using EfficientNet/ResNet.
  - 🌊 **Frequency Stream:** "Locks" onto invisible noise fingerprints using **SRM Filters** & **Spectral Analysis**.
- **GenAI Hunter:** Specifically optimized to detect modern Diffusion models (Stable Diffusion, Midjourney v6).
- **Industrial Strength:** Built with DevOps mindset - Containerized, Scalable, and API-ready.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Core:** Python, PyTorch
- **Ops:** Docker, GitHub Actions, Google Colab
- **Interface:** FastAPI, React (Planned)
